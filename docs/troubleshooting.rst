Troubleshooting
===============

The following guide provides solutions to issues that may occur during operation.

Self-Test Fails on Startup
==========================

If the robot does not stand up within two minutes, and does not stand up when :kbd:`L1` + :kbd:`START` is pressed, the startup self-test has failed.
In this case, make sure that the robot is positioned properly as described in the :ref:`Basic Usage Startup Pose<label-basic-usage-startup-pose>` guide.

Robot is Immobile After a fall
==============================

If the robot falls over or experiences unexpected motion during operation using the handheld controller, its self-protection system may be activated.
This system automatically triggers the brakes on the motors to minimize damage to the robot.
To solve this, power cycle the robot.

Remote Controller Fails
=======================

The remote controller may fail during operation.
The following steps can be taken to safely power off the robot if this occurs:

1.  Make sure the robot is at least six feet away from any obstacles.
2.  With two people, hold the head and rear of the robot.
3.  Short press the power button on the battery once and long press until the robot powers off.
4.  Carefully lower the robot to the ground.

Robot Falls Over Easily After Startup
=====================================

The robot may not have been properly calibrated on startup.
Power off the robot using the typical process and make sure it is in the :ref:`Startup Pose<label-basic-usage-startup-pose>` before powering on again.
